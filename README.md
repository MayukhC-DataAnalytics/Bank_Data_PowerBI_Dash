Now Basis the data analysis the insights I get after I created the dashboard:
Demographics & Distribution
1.	Question: What is the most common age group among our customers? 
Answer: The dashboard doesn't directly show the most common age group in terms of count. It shows ranges (e.g., 31-40, 41-50). To find the most common, you'd need the raw data or a visualization that emphasizes the highest count. However, we can see from the "Number of Customers by Age & Gender" chart that the 31-40 age group has a significant number of customers.
2.	Question: Are there more male or female customers? 
        Answer: We can't determine the total number of males vs. females from the dashboard. However, we can see the distribution across age groups. To get a definitive answer, you'd need the raw data.
3.	Question: Which region has the highest number of customers? 
Answer: England has the highest number of customers, as shown in the "Number of Customers by Region" chart (53.79%).
4.	Question: What percentage of customers are classified as "White Collar"? 
Answer: 48.7% of customers are classified as White Collar, as shown in the "Number of Customers by Job" chart.
Balance Analysis
5.	Question: Which gender holds the largest share of the total customer balance? 
Answer: Male customers hold the largest share of the total balance (54.28%), as indicated in the "Balance by Gender" chart.

6.	Question: What is the maximum balance held by a customer in the dataset? 
Answer: The maximum balance is 6290, as shown in the "Max Balance by Age" section.
7.	Question: What is the minimum balance held by a customer in the dataset? 
Answer: The minimum balance is 15, as shown in the "Min Balance by Age" section.
8.	Question: Is there a clear correlation between age and balance?
 Answer: The "Balance by Age & Gender" chart suggests a possible correlation, with balances tending to be higher in the 30-50 age range, but further statistical analysis would be needed to confirm this.
Time-Based Analysis
9.	Question: How does the number of customers change over time (by quarter)? 
Answer: The "Count of Name by Month, Quarter and Gender" chart shows an upward trend in the number of customers from Qtr 1 to Qtr 4. The chart indicates growth over the quarters.
10.	Question: Are there any noticeable seasonal patterns in customer acquisition? 
Answer: From the data provided, the chart shows growth, but to determine seasonality, you would need to analyze data over a more extended period (several years) to identify recurring patterns.
